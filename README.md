## :world_map: PREPARE PHASE: Gathering and Understanding Data Sources
- **Data Source**: [Fitbit Fitness Tracker Public Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)
- **Data Overview**: This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users.
Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level
output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity,
steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits. The data set consists of 11 csv files in total.
When we bring them together, we can access the date range 03.12-04.12 and 35 users.I will use only the 5 of the csv files.

### ROCCC Aproach:

- **Reliablity**: The source of the data tells us that the data was taken from thirty users. However, when we check
the data, we come across thirty-five users. This raises some doubts about the accuracy of the data.

- **Original**: Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including
minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. This dataset generated by respondents
to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-04.12.2016.

- **Comprehensive**: When the data is examined, the fact that it does not include data such as age, gender, race,
  region of residence shows that the data is not comprehensive. This will cause certain limits and prevent us from
  reaching a certain level of insight.
  
- **Curent**: Data is from 03.12.2016 to 04.12.2016 so it is not current so some trends may have changed over time.
  
- **Cited**: Data has CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Möbius from a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
 
 :exclamation: ***Limitations***: Small sample size, possible bias, and lack of diversity.

## :computer: PROCESS PHASE: Cleaning and Transforming Data

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I started cleaning the data, I decided to use Spreadsheet based on the size of the data.After importing the
datasets into the Spreadsheet I checked the duplicates,nulls and incorrect values.There was no duplicate value or any nulls.I remove some of the 
columns that with irrelevant information.

## :mag: ANALYZE PHASE: Performing Calculations and Identifying Trends
### SQL Analysis
```sql
-- Aggregating daily activity data
SELECT
  Id,
  ActivityDate,
  SUM(TotalSteps) AS daily_steps,
  SUM(Calories) AS daily_calories
FROM `global-sign-450613-m9.Bellabeat_CaseStudy.dailyActivity_merged_031216-041116`
GROUP BY Id, ActivityDate
ORDER BY ActivityDate;

-- Identifying user activity levels
SELECT Id,
       AVG(TotalSteps) AS avg_daily_steps,
       CASE 
           WHEN AVG(TotalSteps) >= 10000 THEN 'Highly Active'
           WHEN AVG(TotalSteps) BETWEEN 5000 AND 9999 THEN 'Moderately Active'
           ELSE 'Sedentary'
       END AS activity_level
FROM `global-sign-450613-m9.Bellabeat_CaseStudy.dailyActivity_merged_031216-041116`
GROUP BY Id;
```

## :chart: SHARE PHASE: Creating Visuals and Insights

### R Data Visualization
```r
# Steps vs. Calories Burned
ggplot(data_clean, aes(x = total_steps, y = total_calories)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Steps vs Calories Burned")
```

## :rocket: ACT PHASE: Final Recommendations
1. **Target Audience Identification**: Focus marketing efforts on active users who track steps and calories frequently.
2. **Product Enhancement**: Improve sleep-tracking features based on observed sleep patterns.
3. **Strategic Marketing**: Personalize app recommendations based on user activity levels.
